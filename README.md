US population and the popular vote

My research included analyzing US presidential election popular vote data and census population data from 1856 to 2020.  The data retrieved for my analysis included US population since 1910 from the US Census Bureau and statistical data from the Federal Election Commission. The data sets were saved in csv format and loaded into Pandas DataFrames, cleaned by dropping unnecessary columns, replacing NaN values with 0, and converting values to integers.
The analysis finds that Republican vote increases have a moderate positive correlation of 0.35 with population increases, while Democratic vote increases have almost no correlation at -0.05. This indicates Republican popular vote tends to increase more as population increases compared to Democrats. I observed consistent US population growth from 1910 to 2020. 
Further analysis calculates the proportion of Democratic and Republican votes to total population over time. Both proportions significantly change over time, indicating the popular vote is not directly proportional to population size for either party. When conducting my calculations factoring the proportional rate into my proportion difference code, I received a vote to population proportion rate of 25% and 10% for Democratic and Republican votes respectively. 
In summary, the analysis shows Republican popular vote growth has a stronger link to population size compared to Democrats historically, but overall the popular vote is not simply proportional to population changes. More detailed regression analysis would help further quantify and explain the relationships between population, year, and party vote percentages, including factoring in voter turnout, the electoral vote, and factoring in individuals who are not eligible to vote in the US population. 

Individuals casting their votes for Republican and Democratic presidential candidates from 1856 to 2020

In analyzing the historical voting patterns of the United States from 1856 to 2020, data was summarized in 50-year increments to elucidate the prevailing trends and outcomes of presidential elections. From 1856 to 1900, the nascent Republican Party, initially unified by their opposition to slavery's expansion, suffered an early loss but swiftly gained prominence with Abraham Lincoln's victories in the 1860 and 1864 elections. The period of 1901 to 1950 was largely dominated by Republican presidencies, punctuated by Democratic wins during the Wilson and Roosevelt eras, where the latter's New Deal policies and wartime leadership solidified a significant Democratic presence in four consecutive elections. The subsequent half-century, from 1951 to 2000, was marked by a more equitable tug-of-war between the two major parties. The Democrats secured notable wins with Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, and Clinton, while the Republicans consolidated their base under Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, and the senior Bush. The most recent two decades, 2001 to 2020, have been characterized by closely contested elections, with Republican victories in the early 2000s and a Democratic resurgence with President Obama's two terms. The pendulum swung back with President Trump's election in 2016, followed by a significant Democratic win in 2020 with President Biden. Across the historical tapestry, both parties have witnessed ebbs and flows in their political fortunes, with varied and complex factors influencing each election outcome. The latter part of the timeline shows a trend towards higher vote counts for both parties, signaling a combination of increased voter turnout and population growth.
To graph this data, I chose a Jupyter notebook to manage and visualize the information. A Data Frame was pivotal for ensuring the data was neatly organized, which is essential for accurate graphical interpretation. The line graph I created served as a detailed illustration of each party's vote count through the years, with color-coding and markers enhancing clarity and readability. I then employed a bar graph to provide a comparative view of the two partiesâ€™ results in each election year. The contrasting colors offered a straightforward visual comparison of the parties' performance. For hypothesis testing, I used a t-test to statistically compare the mean votes of both parties. I set the significance level at 0.05, following standard practice for determining statistical significance. The p-value obtained was 0.9682930895917796, significantly higher than the chosen alpha level. This result led me to maintain the null hypothesis, suggesting no significant difference in the mean number of votes between the two parties during the years studied.
